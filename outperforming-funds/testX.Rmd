```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message = F}

library(tidyverse)

for (i in unique(mtcars$cyl)) {
  print(mtcars %>% 
    filter(cyl == i) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = wt)) +
    geom_point())
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
