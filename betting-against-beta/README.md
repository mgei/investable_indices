# Betting against beta

## Low beta anomaly (Andrea Frazzini)

Presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHE0queiTuA

Betting against beta -> zero beta target, does it has positive return?

leverage aversion (=leverage constraint, actual or psychological) & risk anomaly 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-volatility_anomaly (low-vola anomaly)

the day alpha died

low beta do too good, high beta too bad (according to their beta) -> low beta anomaly

2x LETF is bought because of leverage constraints

the CAPM is dead (Fama/French paper)

Betting against beta should work better if borrowing contraints are higher.
People cannot leverage in these periods therefore buy high beta stocks with lowers their returns.

Frazzini presentation: Warren Buffet has low beta portfolio (value stocks tend to have lower beta)

Writing options is also a way to sell (short) leverage

beta compression: in a market turndown all stocks drop, beta goes to 1 for all stocks (all market crashes)
